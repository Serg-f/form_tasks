      <p><strong>Day 1: Introduction to Django Forms</strong></p>
      <p>Study the basics of Django forms, including how to create a form class, render form fields, and handle form submissions.</p>
      <p>Read the official Django documentation on forms: <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/forms/" target="_blank">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/forms/</a></p>
      <p>Complete a practical task: Create a simple contact form in Django that collects a user's name, email, and message. Implement form validation and display appropriate error messages if the form is submitted with invalid data.</p>

      <p><strong>Day 2: Working with Model Forms</strong></p>
      <p>Learn about Model Forms in Django, which are forms automatically generated from a Django model.</p>
      <p>Explore how to create, save, update, and delete model instances using Model Forms.</p>
      <p>Review the documentation on Model Forms: <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/forms/modelforms/" target="_blank">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/forms/modelforms/</a></p>
      <p>Practical task: Create a model called "Task" with fields like "title" and "description." Build a form using Model Form that allows users to create and update tasks. Implement validation rules for the form fields.</p>

      <p><strong>Day 3: Advanced Form Features</strong></p>
      <p>Dive into advanced form features in Django, such as form widgets, formsets, and form validation.</p>
      <p>Understand how to customize form rendering, add form fields dynamically, and handle formsets for working with multiple forms.</p>
      <p>Read the documentation on form widgets: <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/forms/widgets/" target="_blank">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/forms/widgets/</a></p>
      <p>Practical task: Extend the Task model from the previous day by adding a "priority" field. Implement a custom form widget for the "priority" field, such as a dropdown or radio buttons. Create a formset that allows users to add and delete multiple tasks at once.</p>

      <p><strong>Day 4: Django Models and Database Relationships</strong></p>
      <p>Learn about Django models, database relationships, and how to define various types of relationships, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many.</p>
      <p>Understand the different types of model fields available in Django and their usage.</p>
      <p>Review the documentation on Django models: <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/db/models/" target="_blank">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/db/models/</a></p>
      <p>Practical task: Create a model called "Author" and another model called "Book." Establish a one-to-many relationship between them, where an author can have multiple books. Implement CRUD functionality for authors and books using Django's ORM.</p>

      <p><strong>Day 5: Advanced Model Concepts</strong></p>
      <p>Explore advanced model concepts in Django, such as model inheritance, abstract models, and model managers.</p>
      <p>Study how to query and filter model data using Django's ORM.</p>
      <p>Read the documentation on model inheritance: <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/db/models/#model-inheritance" target="_blank">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/db/models/#model-inheritance</a></p>
      <p>Practical task: Extend the "Book" model from the previous day by creating a new model called "Ebook" that inherits from "Book." Implement a custom model manager for the "Ebook" model that returns only ebooks with a specific format (e.g., PDF). Write queries to retrieve ebooks using the model manager.</p>
