Day 1: Introduction to Django Forms

- Study the basics of Django forms, including how to create a form class, render form fields, and handle form submissions.
- Read the official Django documentation on forms: <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/forms/>
- Complete a practical task: Create a simple contact form in Django that collects a user's name, email, and message. Implement form validation and display appropriate error messages if the form is submitted with invalid data.

Day 2: Working with Model Forms

- Learn about Model Forms in Django, which are forms automatically generated from a Django model.
- Explore how to create, save, update, and delete model instances using Model Forms.
- Review the documentation on Model Forms: <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/forms/modelforms/>
- Practical task: Create a model called "Task" with fields like "title" and "description." Build a form using Model Form that allows users to create and update tasks. Implement validation rules for the form fields.

Day 3: Advanced Form Features

- Dive into advanced form features in Django, such as form widgets, formsets, and form validation.
- Understand how to customize form rendering, add form fields dynamically, and handle formsets for working with multiple forms.
- Read the documentation on form widgets: <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/forms/widgets/>
- Practical task: Extend the Task model from the previous day by adding a "priority" field. Implement a custom form widget for the "priority" field, such as a dropdown or radio buttons. Create a formset that allows users to add and delete multiple tasks at once.

Day 4: Django Models and Database Relationships

- Learn about Django models, database relationships, and how to define various types of relationships, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many.
- Understand the different types of model fields available in Django and their usage.
- Review the documentation on Django models: <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/db/models/>
- Practical task: Create a model called "Author" and another model called "Book." Establish a one-to-many relationship between them, where an author can have multiple books. Implement CRUD functionality for authors and books using Django's ORM.

Day 5: Advanced Model Concepts

- Explore advanced model concepts in Django, such as model inheritance, abstract models, and model managers.
- Study how to query and filter model data using Django's ORM.
- Read the documentation on model inheritance: <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/db/models/#model-inheritance>
- Practical task: Extend the "Book" model from the previous day by creating a new model called "Ebook" that inherits from "Book." Implement a custom model manager for the "Ebook" model that returns only ebooks with a specific format (e.g., PDF). Write queries to retrieve ebooks using the model manager.

After completing each practical task, share your code or answers, and I'll be happy to review them and provide feedback. Good luck with your Django studies!
